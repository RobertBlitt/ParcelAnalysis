- Wildfire defensible space planning
- Climate adaptation measure targeting

## Key Distinction from Existing Approaches

**Traditional Regional Prioritization**:
*"Which locations are most important for intervention?"*
- Comparative risk assessment
- Resource allocation optimization
- Regional policy guidance

**Site-Specific Solution Matching** (This Framework):
*"What interventions will work at specific locations?"*
- Individual unit optimization
- Implementation feasibility assessment  
- Property-level decision support

This distinction represents a significant methodological contribution to spatial decision science.
