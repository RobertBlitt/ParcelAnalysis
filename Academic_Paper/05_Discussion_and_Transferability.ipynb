    "\n",
    "The three-stage analytical framework demonstrated in this Hawaii cesspool case study represents a generalizable approach to site-specific environmental decision support that extends far beyond wastewater management applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Universal Three-Stage Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 1: Characteristics Compilation**\n",
    "*Systematic compilation of relevant spatial and attribute characteristics for each decision unit*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodological Essence**: Comprehensive site characterization using available spatial data, field measurements, and regulatory databases to create a complete attribute profile for each decision unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Professional Terminology**: Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transferable Elements**:\n",
    "- **Decision Units**: Parcels, watersheds, facilities, administrative boundaries, or any spatially defined units\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Any measurable attributes relevant to the decision context (physical, environmental, regulatory, economic, social)\n",
    "- **Data Integration**: Multi-source data compilation with standardized attribute structures\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 2: Suitability Matrix Analysis**  \n",
    "*Multi-criteria evaluation using binary or weighted compatibility assessment*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodological Essence**: Systematic evaluation of solution-characteristic compatibility using established thresholds, regulatory requirements, or performance criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Professional Terminology**: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) with constraint-based filtering\n",
    "\n",

    "## 5.2 Distinction from Regional Prioritization Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Comparative Analysis Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Regional Prioritization | Site-Specific Solution Matching |\n",
    "|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Primary Question** | \"Which locations need intervention most?\" | \"What interventions work here?\" |\n",
    "| **Scale Focus** | Comparative/Regional | Individual Unit/Local |\n",
    "| **Output Type** | Priority Rankings | Implementation Recommendations |\n",
    "| **Decision Support** | Resource Allocation | Technical Selection |\n",
    "| **User Audience** | Policymakers/Planners | Property Owners/Implementers |\n",
    "| **Example Application** | HCPT Risk Prioritization | Matrix Technology Assessment |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methodological Complementarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches are **complementary rather than competing**. Regional prioritization (like HCPT) identifies *where* to focus resources, while site-specific solution matching (like the Matrix) determines *what* to implement at those locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integrated Workflow**:\n",
    "1. **Regional Analysis** → Identify priority areas for intervention\n",
    "2. **Site-Specific Analysis** → Determine feasible solutions within priority areas\n",
    "3. **Implementation Planning** → Optimize resource allocation and technical approaches\n",
