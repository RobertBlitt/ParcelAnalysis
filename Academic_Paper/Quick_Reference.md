## Key Contributions Documented

### **Universal Three-Stage Framework**
1. **Characteristics Compilation** → Environmental Site Assessment + GIS Analysis
2. **Suitability Matrix Analysis** → Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis + Constraint Filtering  
3. **Site-Specific Solution Matching** → Spatial Decision Support + Optimization

### **Critical Distinction Identified**
- **Regional Prioritization** (HCPT): "Which locations need intervention most?"
- **Site-Specific Matching** (Matrix): "What interventions work here?"

### **Transferable Applications**
- Renewable energy siting
- Ecosystem restoration strategy selection
- Development suitability assessment
- Agricultural land use optimization
- Public facility location analysis

## Commercial Potential
- Environmental consulting methodology
- Government agency decision support tools
- Software development opportunities
- Professional planning practice standards

## Academic Contribution
Framework addresses critical gap between regional prioritization methods and implementation-focused decision support, providing systematic approach to site-specific environmental solution selection.
