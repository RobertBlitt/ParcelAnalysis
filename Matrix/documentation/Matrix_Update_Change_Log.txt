Updated File: C:\Users\rober\OneDrive\Documents\GIS_Projects\ParcelAnalysis\Matrix\Technology_Matrix_Screening_Updated.xlsx

CHANGES MADE:
============

1. ADDED DISCLAIMER COLUMNS:
   - SCREENING_TOOL_ONLY: Emphasizes preliminary screening purpose
   - SITE_TESTING_REQD: Requires site-specific evaluation
   - DOH_PERMIT_REQD: Mandates regulatory compliance

2. UPDATED SOIL CLASSIFICATION APPROACH:
   - Replaced site-specific soil requirements with screening-level classifications
   - Added four screening categories based on NRCS KSAT data
   - Conservative approach requiring professional follow-up

3. SCREENING-LEVEL CLASSIFICATIONS ADDED:
   - High_Infiltration_Potential: KSAT >25 μm/s from soil survey data
   - Moderate_Infiltration_Potential: KSAT 5-25 μm/s from soil survey data  
   - Low_Infiltration_Potential: KSAT <5 μm/s from soil survey data
   - Data_Insufficient: No reliable soil survey data available

4. CONSERVATIVE DEFAULT VALUES:
   - All screening columns default to 0 (not suitable)
   - Requires case-by-case professional evaluation
   - Emphasizes need for site-specific testing

RATIONALE:
=========
- Matrix now serves as screening tool for planning purposes only
- Removes inappropriate site-specific design elements
- Adds extensive disclaimers about limitations
- Aligns with professional engineering requirements
- Meets academic standards for uncertainty acknowledgment

NEXT STEPS:
==========
1. Review updated Matrix with subject matter experts
2. Populate screening columns with appropriate technology compatibility
3. Test screening approach with pilot parcels
4. Document validation and verification procedures
5. Integrate with master attribute table workflow
