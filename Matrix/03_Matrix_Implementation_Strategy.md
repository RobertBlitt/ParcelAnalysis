## **Technical Development Strategy**

### **Development Environment:**
- **Primary Platform:** Python with ArcGIS Pro integration
- **Web Framework:** Flask/Django for web interfaces
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data
- **Frontend:** React for responsive user interfaces
- **Hosting:** Hawaii state infrastructure or cloud deployment

### **Data Architecture:**
```
Source Data → Processing Pipeline → Analysis Engine → User Interface
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
• HCPT layers  • Standardization    • Constraint     • Property owner
• DOH database • Quality control     • Technology     • Engineer tools  
• County GIS   • Spatial analysis   • Cost models    • DOH interface
• NRCS soils   • Update workflows   • Ranking logic  • Reporting
```

### **API Development:**
```python
# Core Matrix API structure
class MatrixAPI:
    def analyze_parcel(self, tmk):
        """Main analysis endpoint"""
        constraints = self.assess_constraints(tmk)
        technologies = self.match_technologies(constraints)
        recommendations = self.rank_options(technologies)
        return self.format_results(recommendations)
    
    def batch_analyze(self, tmk_list):
        """Batch processing for multiple parcels"""
        return [self.analyze_parcel(tmk) for tmk in tmk_list]
    
    def get_technology_details(self, tech_type):
        """Technology specification lookup"""
        return self.technology_database[tech_type]
```

## **Quality Assurance Framework**

### **Validation Testing:**
1. **Regulatory Compliance Testing**
   - Verify all HAR 11-62 calculations are correct
   - Test setback calculations against surveyed parcels
   - Validate soil interpretation against known sites

2. **Technology Matching Validation**
   - Compare recommendations against engineer assessments
   - Test edge cases and constraint combinations
   - Verify cost estimates against actual project costs

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Confirm data flow from HCPT components
   - Test Infrastructure Overlay coordination
   - Validate DOH workflow integration

### **Performance Metrics:**
- **Accuracy:** >90% of recommendations match engineer assessment
- **Speed:** <2 minutes processing time per parcel
- **Reliability:** <1% system downtime
- **User Satisfaction:** >80% positive feedback on usefulness

## **Training and Support Strategy**
