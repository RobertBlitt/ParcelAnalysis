    "- **Do not move `ParcelAnalysis.gdb`** after project setup; all geodatabase links depend on its location.\n",
    "- **Never edit or overwrite files in any `Data/County/`, `Data/State/`, or `Data/_Raw/` folder.**\n",
    "- **Update the product README** (`Outputs/readme/`) every time a new data product is created or revised, especially if methods or assumptions change.\n",
    "- **Keep scripts modular** and version-controlled.\n",
    "- **Log all workflow decisions** (including assumptions, method choices, and QA steps) in this notebook and in relevant README files.\n",
    "- **For all derived data products:** Clearly document sources, transformation steps, and rationale for any standardization or project-specific rules.\n",
