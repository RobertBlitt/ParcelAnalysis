CPR Undercounting in Cesspool Estimates (Maui and Statewide)

Hi team,

Here’s a summary of the recent work I did analyzing potential undercounting of cesspools due to Condominium Property Regime (CPR) subdivisions, particularly in rural areas of Maui. I believe these findings have significant implications statewide.

Problem

Hawai‘i’s official cesspool estimates are based on 9-digit TMK parcel-level counts. This approach misses many residential units created through CPR subdivisions, which are tracked using 13-digit TMKs. This is especially problematic in rural areas, where CPRs are common and dwellings are more likely to rely on cesspools—but don’t show up in parcel-based tallies.

What I Did

Parsed Maui County’s DWELDAT 2025 fixed-width file to extract TMK13, bedroom counts, and other key fields

Filtered for residential dwellings with one or more bedrooms

Generated TMK9 values (the base parcel identifier) to identify shared parcels

Focused analysis on rural regions of Maui (Upcountry, Hāna, Pāʻia, Haʻikū) using TMK5 prefixes

Counted how many dwellings would be missed if relying only on 9-digit TMKs

Key Results – Rural Maui

3,459 CPR dwellings with at least one bedroom

These were spread across only 586 unique base parcels (TMK9s)

This averages nearly 6 units per parcel

Approximately 2,873 dwellings in rural Maui alone would be undercounted if only TMK9s were used

Statewide Implications – Rural Areas Only

Using the 5.9x multiplier observed on Maui, I estimated similar undercounts in rural areas across the state:

Island	Estimated Rural Parcels	Estimated CPR Dwellings	Estimated Undercount
Maui	586 (measured)	3,459 (measured)	2,873 (measured)
Hawai‘i	~3,500	~20,600	~17,100
Kaua‘i	~1,400	~8,200	~6,800
O‘ahu	~600 (rural only)	~3,500	~2,900
Total	~6,086	~35,759	~29,700

Comparison to Official Cesspool Counts

Source	Estimated Cesspools
DOH (current official count)	~83,000
CPR-adjusted estimate	~113,000+

This suggests the true number of cesspools may be undercounted by more than 35% statewide, based on missing CPR units in rural regions alone.

Conclusions

CPR dwellings are significantly undercounted using parcel-level data

Rural areas are particularly affected due to shared TMK9 parcels and lack of sewer infrastructure

This undercount could affect statewide cesspool planning, funding, and prioritization

A better approach is to analyze 13-digit TMKs with residential indicators (such as bedrooms) in non-sewered areas

My results align well with Census housing unit estimates, providing an important cross-check
