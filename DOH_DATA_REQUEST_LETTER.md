**Attention**: Wastewater Branch Manager

**RE: Data Sharing Request for Cesspool Inventory - University of Hawaii Research Project**

Dear [Name],

I am writing to request access to the most current Hawaii cesspool inventory database for a research project being conducted by the University of Hawaii Water Resources Research Center (UH WRRC).

### Project Overview

**Project Title**: Hawaii Cesspool Technology Suitability Matrix - Infrastructure Feasibility Assessment

**Principal Investigator**: [PI Name], UH WRRC

**Project Duration**: [Start Date] through [End Date]

**Funding Source**: [If applicable - State appropriation/grant/etc.]

This research directly supports implementation of Act 217 (SLH 2024), which requires development of a geospatial overlay to identify areas where cesspool conversions can be addressed through centralized wastewater infrastructure expansion. Our project extends this mandate by developing a parcel-level technology suitability assessment framework for properties where onsite systems remain the only viable option.

### Data Request

We respectfully request access to the following datasets:

1. **Cesspool Inventory Database**
   - All known cesspool locations statewide (point features preferred)
   - Associated Tax Map Key (TMK) identifiers
   - Installation dates (if available)
   - Status (active/inactive/converted)
   - Current record count and last update date

2. **Format Preference**
   - Geodatabase (.gdb) or Shapefile (.shp) with coordinates
   - CSV or Excel with TMK and address information
   - Any format with spatial reference information

3. **Temporal Coverage**
   - Most recent inventory available
   - Historical records if available for conversion tracking

### Data Usage

The requested data will be used exclusively for:

1. **Academic Research**: Development of a scientifically rigorous methodology for assessing onsite wastewater technology suitability at the parcel level based on HAR 11-62 requirements

2. **Planning Tool Development**: Creation of a geospatial analysis framework that evaluates physical site characteristics, regulatory constraints, and infrastructure proximity to determine technology feasibility

3. **Policy Support**: Production of maps, reports, and decision support tools to assist counties, DOH, and property owners in meeting the 2050 cesspool elimination mandate

4. **Publication**: Results will be shared through peer-reviewed publications, technical reports, and presentations at professional conferences, with all outputs acknowledging DOH as the data source

### Data Security and Confidentiality

We understand that cesspool inventory data may contain sensitive information. UH WRRC commits to the following:

- **Secure Storage**: All data will be stored on password-protected, institutional servers with restricted access
- **Limited Distribution**: Data access limited to project team members with legitimate research need
- **Confidentiality**: Property owner names and personally identifiable information will not be published or shared
- **Aggregation**: Public-facing products will present results at census block, tract, or county level to protect individual property privacy
- **Acknowledgment**: All products will clearly state that data were provided by DOH Wastewater Branch with appropriate disclaimers regarding planning-level use

### Expected Deliverables to DOH

In exchange for data access, UH WRRC will provide DOH with:

1. **Technical Report**: Comprehensive methodology documentation for the technology suitability assessment framework

2. **Geospatial Database**: Master Parcel Attribute Table (MPAT) with calculated site characteristics and technology compatibility scores

3. **Decision Support Tools**: Maps and analytical products identifying parcels by technology suitability categories

4. **Quality Assurance Documentation**: Validation reports documenting accuracy and confidence levels

5. **Presentation**: Findings presentation to DOH staff and stakeholders (if desired)

6. **Future Updates**: Offer to collaborate on periodic updates as new data become available

All deliverables will be provided in formats compatible with DOH systems and workflows.

### Project Timeline

**Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Data acquisition and organization  
**Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Data standardization and attribute calculation  
**Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Analysis and technology suitability assessment  
**Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Deliverable production and documentation  

**Estimated Date for Initial Results**: [Date, approximately 8 weeks from start]  
**Final Report Completion**: [Date, approximately 12 weeks from start]

### Data Attribution

All products using DOH cesspool inventory data will include the following attribution:

> "Cesspool location data provided by the Hawaii Department of Health, Wastewater Branch. The State of Hawaii makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of this data for any particular purpose."

### Relevant Statutory Authority

This research supports:

- **Act 125 (SLH 2017)**: Requires cesspool upgrades statewide by 2050
- **Act 132 (SLH 2017)**: Established Hawaii Cesspool Prioritization Tool
- **Act 217 (SLH 2024)**: Requires infrastructure feasibility overlay development
- **HAR Chapter 11-62**: Individual Wastewater Systems regulations

### Additional Information

We would be pleased to meet with DOH staff to discuss this request, answer questions, clarify project scope, or demonstrate our preliminary analytical framework. We can also provide:

- Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval (if applicable)
- Data Use Agreement template for DOH review
- Examples of previous UH WRRC publications demonstrating responsible data use
- References from other agencies we have worked with

### Request for Response

We would greatly appreciate a response to this request within [timeframe, e.g., two weeks]. If additional information is needed to process this request, or if there are forms or agreements that must be completed, please let us know and we will provide them promptly.

We understand that DOH may have concerns about data sensitivity, appropriate use, or publication. We are fully committed to working with DOH to address any concerns and to ensure that this research supports, rather than complicates, your mission to protect public health and Hawaii's water resources.

Thank you for considering this request. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with DOH on this important work to achieve the 2050 cesspool elimination goal.

Respectfully,

**NOTES FOR FINALIZATION**:

1. **Fill in all bracketed information** with actual names, dates, and contact details
2. **Customize based on relationship**: If you already have a working relationship with DOH, adjust tone accordingly
3. **Check DOH procedures**: Call first to ask about data request process - there may be a formal application
4. **Prepare required documents**: Have IRB approval, institutional letterhead, data use agreement ready
5. **Consider timing**: Submit request when you're ready to begin work - don't request data months in advance
6. **Follow up appropriately**: If no response in 2 weeks, polite follow-up email or phone call
7. **Be flexible**: Be prepared to modify your request based on DOH constraints or concerns
8. **Offer meeting**: Sometimes easier to explain project in person and build trust
9. **Emphasize mutual benefit**: Frame as collaboration, not just data extraction
10. **Have backup plan**: If full database not available, ask for subset or aggregate data

**ALTERNATIVE APPROACH**: Instead of formal letter, consider initial informal inquiry via email or phone to understand DOH's data sharing policies and preferences before drafting formal request.
