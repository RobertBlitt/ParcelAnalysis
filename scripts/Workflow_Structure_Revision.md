# Hawaii Cesspool Matrix Analysis - Revised Workflow Structure

**Academic Framework for MPAT Development and Matrix Technology Assessment**

## Proposed Workflow Structure

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- **Purpose**: Gathering layers, checking projections, standardizing data
- **Activities**: 
  - Field type standardization
  - Decimal precision corrections  
  - Coordinate system verification
  - Data quality validation
  - Preliminary cleaning and formatting

### 2. **Geospatial Analysis** 
- **Purpose**: Execute tools and scripts to populate data fields for MPAT joining
- **Activities**:
  - Distance calculations (wells, shoreline, surface water)
  - Slope analysis from DEM
  - Soil percolation rate classification
  - Regulatory overlay intersections (SMA, flood zones)
  - Lot size and building footprint analysis

### 3. **Data Validation**
- **Purpose**: Verify accuracy and completeness before final assembly
- **Activities**:
  - Cross-validation between datasets
  - Completeness assessments  
  - Outlier detection and review
  - Regulatory compliance verification
  - Quality assurance protocols

### 4. **Data Assembly and Processing**
- **Purpose**: Create MPAT and execute Matrix technology assessment
- **Activities**:
  - Join validated data into Master Parcel Attribute Table (MPAT)
  - Execute Matrix suitability analysis for each parcel
  - Generate technology recommendation columns
  - Create Site Specific Potentially Suitable Cesspool Replacement Technologies (SSPSCRT) field
  - **Note**: Advanced Treatment Units should work for virtually all locations (rare edge cases excepted) - verify this assumption in results validation

### 5. **Results Refinement**
- **Purpose**: Format outputs for web mapping and public interface
- **Activities**:
  - Create user-friendly result formatting
  - Develop address-based lookup system
  - Generate standardized output format:
    - Site Limiting Factors: [specific constraints identified]
    - Required/Recommended cesspool replacement technology: [technology name]
  - Integration preparation for existing HCPT web tools

### 6. **Documentation and Deployment**
- **Purpose**: Academic documentation and public tool updates  
- **Activities**:
  - Clean up Jupyter notebooks (planned vs. actual implementation)
  - Report writing based on notebook documentation and chat logs
  - Update public-facing web tools with new functionality
  - Academic paper preparation
  - Methodology documentation for reproducibility

## Terminology Assessment

**Your terminology is accurate and appropriate:**

- **MPAT (Master Parcel Attribute Table)**: Correct - this is the comprehensive data table keyed to TMK
- **SSPSCRT**: Descriptive and precise, though long. Could also consider "Parcel-Specific Technology Recommendations" (PSTR) as shorter alternative
- **Site Limiting Factors**: Standard terminology in environmental site assessment
- **Geospatial Analysis**: More precise than "Core Processing" - correctly describes the spatial analytical operations

## Academic Appropriateness

This structure is much better suited for:
- ✅ **Thesis/dissertation chapters**
- ✅ **Peer-reviewed publication**  
- ✅ **Technical reports for DOH/counties**
- ✅ **Professional presentations**
- ✅ **Grant reporting**

## Critical Note for Results Validation

**Advanced Treatment Unit (ATU) Default Assumption**: 
- ATUs should indeed work for most parcels (high-level treatment, flexible installation)
- Edge cases to verify: extreme slopes, very shallow depth to groundwater, extremely small lots
- **Action item**: Include ATU feasibility check in Data Validation phase
- **Matrix verification**: Ensure Matrix doesn't over-restrict ATU applications
