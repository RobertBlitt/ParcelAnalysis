# Data Validation Phase

**Academic Framework for Hawaii Cesspool Matrix Analysis**

## Purpose
Verify accuracy and completeness of all data before Matrix technology assessment processing. Implement quality assurance protocols to ensure reliable results.

## Validation Framework

### 03a_Completeness_Assessment
- Check field completion rates across all data layers
- Identify records with missing critical information
- Flag parcels requiring additional data collection

### 03b_Accuracy_Verification
- Cross-validate distance calculations
- Verify slope calculations against known benchmarks
- Check soil classification consistency with NRCS standards

### 03c_Regulatory_Compliance_Check
- Verify HAR 11-62 requirement implementation
- Check setback distance calculations (1000ft wells, 50ft water/shore)
- Validate slope and soil thresholds

### 03d_ATU_Feasibility_Check
**Critical Validation**: Advanced Treatment Units should work for ~95% of parcels
- Identify edge cases where ATUs may not be suitable
- Document limiting factors (extreme slopes, shallow groundwater, tiny lots)
- Validate Matrix assumption about ATU universal applicability

## Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: % of records with all required fields populated
- **Accuracy**: % of calculated values within acceptable tolerance
- **Consistency**: % of records passing logical consistency checks  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: % meeting HAR 11-62 standards

## Critical Checks
1. **Distance Calculations**: No negative distances, reasonable maximums
2. **Slope Values**: 0-100% range, no null values in residential areas  
3. **Soil Data**: Valid percolation rates, proper NRCS classifications
4. **TMK Integrity**: All records have valid TMK identifiers

## Edge Case Documentation
- Parcels with extreme characteristics
- Records failing multiple suitability criteria  
- Properties requiring special engineering review
- Locations where standard Matrix logic may not apply

## Dependencies
- Enhanced foundation table from Phase 2
- HAR 11-62 regulatory standards
- Known benchmark data for validation
- Historical ATU installation records (if available)

## Outputs  
- Data quality assessment report
- Validated dataset ready for Matrix processing
- Edge case documentation for special handling
- Confidence level assignments by record

## Next Phase
After validation, clean data flows to **04_Data_Assembly_Processing** for Matrix technology assessment.
