# Data Preparation Phase

**Academic Framework for Hawaii Cesspool Matrix Analysis**

## Purpose
Standardize and validate input data layers to support Matrix technology assessment. All processing focuses strictly on HAR 11-62 Subchapter 3 (Individual Wastewater Systems) for single-family residential properties.

## Key Extracted Concepts from Previous Work
- **JOIN_LOG tracking system** - Sequential processing with metadata
- **Modular approach** - Each step can be run independently  
- **HAR 11-62 compliance checks** - Built into all processing
- **Quality assurance** - Validation after each step

## Phase Components

### 01a_Foundation_Setup
- Create TMK foundation table from wells distance data
- Establish JOIN_LOG tracking system
- Initialize fields for subsequent data joins

### 01b_Data_Standardization  
- Verify coordinate systems (UTM Zone 4, NAD 83 HARN)
- Standardize field names and data types
- Check decimal precision for distance calculations

### 01c_Quality_Validation
- Assess data completeness
- Identify and flag potential errors
- Document data source confidence levels

## Dependencies
- Municipal and domestic wells shapefiles (Dr. Shuler's portal)
- TMK parcel data (statewide)
- HAR 11-62 regulatory requirements

## Outputs
- TMK_Foundation_Master with wells distances
- Standardized field naming conventions
- Quality assessment reports
- Processing logs for reproducibility

## Next Phase
After completion, data flows to **02_Geospatial_Analysis** for slope, soil, and regulatory overlay processing.
