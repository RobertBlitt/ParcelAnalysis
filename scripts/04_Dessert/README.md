# Dessert - Final Assembly

Final assembly and outputs

## Notebooks in this course:

- `04a_Master_Table_Assembly.ipynb`
- `04b_Matrix_Technology_Analysis.ipynb`
- `04c_Results_Export.ipynb`

## Purpose
These are your "dessert" courses - the grand finale where everything comes together into final deliverable products. Like plating a complex dish, these notebooks assemble all your processed ingredients into the final analysis.

## Key Outputs
- Complete master table with all joined data
- Matrix technology compatibility analysis
- Final results in multiple formats (shapefiles, CSV, reports)

## Current Recipes

### 04a_Master_Table_Assembly.ipynb
- **Purpose**: Join all processed layers to TMK foundation
- **Input**: TMK Foundation + all processed layers from Main Course
- **Output**: Complete master table ready for analysis
- **Features**:
  - Spatial joining with validation
  - Join success tracking and reporting
  - Data completeness assessment
  - Export to multiple formats

### Future Recipes (To be developed)
- **04b_Matrix_Technology_Analysis**: Apply the full technology compatibility matrix
- **04c_Results_Export**: Generate final reports, maps, and deliverables

## Assembly Workflow
1. **Load Foundation**: Start with TMK foundation layer
2. **Sequential Joins**: Add each processed layer systematically
3. **Validate Results**: Check join success rates and data completeness
4. **Generate Outputs**: Create final analysis-ready datasets

## Quality Assurance
- Join success rate monitoring
- Field completeness validation
- Technology compatibility statistics
- Documentation of all processing steps

## Dependencies
- TMK Foundation (from Appetizers)
- Processed layers (from Main Course)
- Kitchen Utils for validation functions
